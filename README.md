## Project 1. Olympic games data analysis for the last 120 years.

**_In this Project we will work with the data on the Olympic games participants for the last 120 years._**

The list of performed tasks:
**Task 1. Data Load**
As our data was separated into multiple csv files, we created comb_files function to combine these files into one dataframe for further data analysis.

**Task 2. Data Cleaning**
We fixed our data manually. The alternative would be to use the TryCatch function, that would lead to dropping of an entire damaged files. Fixed files were renamed with “_fixed” postfix.

**Task 3. Age of the youngest athletes**
Find out the age of the youngest athletes of both genders at the Olympic games in the year 1992.

**Task 4. Mean and SD for Height**
Calculate the mean and standard deviation of parameter Height for athletes of each gender.

**Task 5. Mean and SD for Height for female tennis players**
Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the parameter Height for female tennis players (sex = F) at the Olympic games of the year 2000. Round your answer to the first number after the point.

**Task 6. Sport of the heaviest athlete in 2006**
What sport was the 2006 Olympic games heaviest athlete in?

**Task 7. Number of female gold medals in 1980-2010**
How many gold medals were won by women from 1980 to 2010?

**Task 8. John Aalberg and Olympic Games**
How many times has athlete John Aalberg participated in the Olympic Games in different years?

**Task 9. Least and most represented age groups in 2008 Olympic Games**
Identify the least and most represented (by number of participants) age groups for athletes at the 2008 Olympic Games. Possible age groups: [15-25), [25-35), [35-45), [45-55].

**Task 10. Changes of the number of sport types in 1994-2002**
How the number of sport types had change since 1994 until 2002 Olympic games?

**Task 11. Top 3 countries**
Identify top 3 countries by Medal type for the winter and summer Olympic games.

**Task 12. Standardizing of Height parameter**
Create a new parameter Height_z_scores and store the values of the Height variable in it after standardizing it.

**Task 13. Additional_min-max normalization of Height parameter**
Create a new variable Height_min_max_scaled and store the values of the Height variable in it after applying min-max normalization to it.

**Task 14. Comparison of main parameters of both gender participants in Winter Olympic games**
Compare the Height, Weight and Age parameters for men and women who competed in the Winter Olympic games. Please format the results so that we can immediately use them for the article.

**Task 15. Comparison of Team and Medal parameters**
We are especially interested in the parameters Team and Medal. What can you say about them? Do we have any reason to believe that they might be related? How can we define this?

**Task 16. Additional_Test different hypothesis**
Optional task: test several hypotheses using the learned methods.
